### Hello again!

Hello {name}.

Someone (hopefully you) has tried to register again on {product}.

If this was an attempt to sign in (for example on a another device), we've sent you another magic link - {url}

If this was not you attempting to create/access your {product} account there is nothing to worry about as long as your email address has not been compromised.

For future sign-ins at the login page you can leave the password field empty and we will send you a magic link
